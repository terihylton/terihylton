I am a student at Westminster College doing level 2 computer software programming
and I would like to sign up for copilot Git Hub for suggestions. I have been using Stackflow, but it would be great to get immediate suggestions. I believe as a student I can register for free. But, when I try to register. I keep getting referred to trial month sessions. I would welcome advice!
